- [ARCADE Handbook](/assets/documents/ARCADE-Handbook.pdf)Â presents the framework, and describes how to document a software architecture for a new or existing system.
- [ARCADE Example](/assets/documents/ARCADE-Example.pdf) provides an example of how to use the ARCADE architectural description framework from the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain. The example includes a description of the use context of the system, including which environment systems it could interact with. Further, the decomposition of the system in sub- systems and components is described.
